# Problem Description
## Difficulty: <span style="color:orange">Medium</span>
Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine if it is a **valid binary search tree (BST)**.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
