## Learning through Contemplative Writing
Writing and documenting my experiences programming may be the best way for me to really make things stick.

As a student I always preferred doing assignments rather than sitting exams. Something about writing on topics I found
hard to understand helped consolidate that information in my head. Doing research and organising my ideas into a structured
prose that explains a topic or concept to a reader has always made things 'stick'. I think this approach meshes well with the concept of *Contempative Pedagogy*.

>Contemplative Pedagogy is an approach to teaching and learning with the goal of encouraging deep learning through focused attention, reflection, and heightened awareness. Learners are encouraged to engage deeply with course material through contemplation and introspection.[^1]

It is this approach that I believe will improve my skills in programming. I like to code everyday. I usually learn something new, or discover a new technique.
Having a place where I can share these discoveries and contemplate and reflect on them will encourage **deeper** learning and
ultimately understanding. It also gives me an excuse to write whilst producing actionable and measurable goals, such as a blog post. 


Thus, my foray into blogging begins with a simple objective. **To gain a deeper understanding of topics I find interesting.** To finish off I will share why I chose the picture I used as the feature image. The painting,

De Stamtafel: storytelling in a cafe

: by David Oyens (Amsterdam 1842-1902 Brussels)

depicts men sitting around a table listening to someone tell a story. Storytelling is an integral aspect of humanity. Being able to communicate ideas in an interesting way to the world is an
important skill. As I write more I hope I can emulate something similar to this picture. Learning by telling stories of my experiences whilst learning too. Not a bad combo!
